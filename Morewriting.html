                        into her eyes before and I still don't know what is looking in someone eyes for Eternity because 
                        when I look at those eyes it's like I no longer have my eyes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"> People say eyes never lie. I wonder if that's true. What I can see in those eyes was 
                        a lot of love. I tried looking at me by looking in her eyes too. 
                    </p>
                     <p class="para"> Her Brown Eyes and those stupid longer eye contact games where I lost every single time time 
                        I can only say one thing "I really get lost in her eye."

                    I'm not a big fan of watching clouds. They are too slow, but what it took was a one time word "Nephophile"
                    that she randomly sent me with a snap and next was I under a sky full of clouds.
                </p>
                <p class="para"> I like clear sky but now I like clouds more than ever. When you are happy you don't need a reason
                    to smile. It's so natural, but whatever you say there's a question in my mind ?
