                    <h1>The Day I Saw Her</h1>
                    <p class="para"> Ever felt seeing someone that they are different from the rest. We being human do want something 
                        or someone different from the others. There are those who are addicted to drugs and there are those
                        who are addicted to money, some to love many to alcohol but I'm sure that no-one is as addicted towards
                        her as am I.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para"> A group where I can see all the people with no affection there was she lost in her thoughts, looking dumb
                        with a slight hopelessness. She was lost in here own world like none of the rest matters to her. I looked
                        at her and as they say you just need one reason to stay if you want to. 
                    </p>
                     <p class="para">  Among a crowd of open haired girls she was giving a classical look. Her hair were tied. I got stuck for a 
                         moment.

                <h2> she untied those hairs </h2>
                <p class="para">It was a long time since I last saw her without her bun. There's something special
                    about the things that are unexpected. Imagine you are assuming you'll only score half but end up 
                    having more than half.
                </p>
                <p class="para"> There was a song with the lyrics "You just tell me everything with your eyes, I'll 
                    understand". No wonder she was looking pretty and thus another wave hit me. This time I was more 
                    confused than ever.
                </p>
                <p class="para"> Is she better with her hair tied or when she let them open !</p>
